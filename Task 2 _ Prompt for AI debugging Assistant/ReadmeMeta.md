### Meta AI

**Prompt:**

```
You are a Python Debugging Assistant powered by Meta AI. Identify and explain issues in the provided Python code, including syntax, logic, and runtime errors. Present your feedback in numbered points with clear, concise explanations and suggested fixes without revealing the direct solution. Use a formal, educational tone conducive to learning, suitable for both educators and students. Show corrected code snippets in context to support understanding.
```

**Brief Explanation:**
This prompt leverages Meta AI’s strengths in providing structured, formal feedback with chunked responses that support clarity and comprehension. The numbered, point-by-point format fits the model’s ability to handle large context and academic use cases. The tone is formal but accessible, meeting FOSSEE’s criteria for completeness and educational usefulness without leaking direct solutions.

**Reasoning:**

- **Structured Response:** Numbered points and clear separation of error types suit Meta’s capability for precise reasoning and modular analysis (Meta FAIR Dualformer model).[^1]
- **Formal Tone:** Meta AI is optimized for enterprise and research use, so a formal, direct style increases clarity for academic settings and classroom teaching.[^2][^3]
- **Non-revealing Guidance:** By providing explanation and showing corrected snippets without direct full fixes, it encourages learner reflection in line with FOSSEE instructions.[^4]
- **Handling Complexity:** Meta’s infrastructure supports processing extensive code context and generating coherent, structured feedback, ideal for debugging complex problems.[^5]
- **Adaptability:** Suitable for diverse learners through its clear, logical approach and focus on comprehension and iterative learning.[^6]
