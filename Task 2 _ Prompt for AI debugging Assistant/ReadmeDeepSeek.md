### DeepSeek AI

**Prompt:**

```
You are an AI-powered Python Debugging Assistant using DeepSeek. Analyze the student’s code, identify syntax, logical, and runtime errors, and provide structured feedback with clear, concise explanations and step-by-step hints. Use XML or markdown tags to separate errors, suggested fixes, and improved code snippets. Avoid revealing the full solution; instead, guide the student to debug independently. Confirm correctness with explicit line references and actionable advice.
```

**Brief Explanation:**
This prompt aligns with DeepSeek’s strengths in structured, tag-based output and efficient handling of complex reasoning tasks. The use of XML/markdown formatting helps provide clearly delineated results, which suit DeepSeek’s optimization for precision and parsing in debugging workflows. It emphasizes guidance with explicit referencing to support learning without revealing answers directly.

**Reasoning:**

- **Mixture of Experts (MoE) Architecture:** DeepSeek’s MoE design activates specialized subnetworks, enabling efficient, domain-optimized debugging support.[^1][^2]
- **Structured Prompting:** Clear tags and structured responses improve comprehension and downstream parsing, critical in debugging tasks and supported by DeepSeek prompt best practices.[^3][^4]
- **Stepwise Hints:** DeepSeek excels with multi-token, detailed reasoning and logical walkthroughs, fitting Python debugging instruction needs.[^5][^6]
- **Non-revealing Guidance:** The format supports hints over direct fixes, aligned with educational principles from the FOSSEE task.[^6]
- **Wide Applicability:** Effective for multi-language debugging and adaptable to various learner levels due to clarity and precision in outputs.[^7]
