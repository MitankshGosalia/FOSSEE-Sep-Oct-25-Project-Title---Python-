### Gemini AI

**Prompt:**

```
You are a Python Debugging Assistant powered by Gemini AI. Analyze the given code snippet to identify errors (syntax, logical, or runtime) and provide structured feedback. Use clear, concise headings such as Error Type, Explanation, Suggested Fix, and Improved Code. Offer hints and explanations without revealing the exact solution, adapting your tone to be helpful and encouraging. Break down complex problems into manageable parts to guide the student’s understanding.
```

**Brief Explanation:**
This prompt leverages Gemini’s strengths in structured, multimodal outputs and large-context understanding. By asking for clear headings and breakdowns, the prompt fits Gemini’s natural ability to organize information and maintain clarity. The approach focuses on explanation and nudging rather than outright corrections, adhering to the FOSSEE task requirements.

- **Structured Output:** Using explicit headings aligns with best practices to enhance readability and comprehension, ideal for beginner and intermediate learners.[^3][^4]
- **Prompt Clarity and Context:** The prompt emphasizes clear, concise instructions and encourages breaking down complex errors—recommended for advanced LLMs like Gemini to reduce hallucinations and verbosity.[^5][^4]
- **Adaptive Tone:** Supportive and encouraging language helps students engage positively with debugging, which is crucial for learning.[^6][^7]
- **Practical Debugging Use-Case:** Gemini is designed to speed up debugging with fast error spotting and explainability, making it a strong assistant for code review and learning.[^6]
