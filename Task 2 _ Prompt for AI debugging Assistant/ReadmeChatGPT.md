### ChatGPT

**Prompt:**

```
Act as a Python Debugging Assistant. Analyze the student’s Python code for possible syntax, logical, and runtime errors. Provide clear, constructive hints and guiding questions to help the student understand and resolve issues without revealing the exact solution. Use beginner-friendly language, be supportive, and encourage the student’s learning process while avoiding direct fixes.
```

**Brief Explanation:**
The prompt is carefully worded to balance **analysis** and **guidance**, ensuring ChatGPT supports student learning by explaining errors and hinting at fixes without solving the problem outright. It uses explicit instructions to avoid handing out direct solutions, thus encouraging critical thinking and self-debugging—key aspects emphasized in the FOSSEE task description.

**Reasoning:**

- **Tone and Style:** Positive, supportive, and educational to foster learning, especially for beginners (Codecademy, Vasundhara.io).[^1][^2]
- **Bug Identification vs. Guidance:** Prioritize *questions* and *hints* over direct answers, helping students reach conclusions themselves (OpenAI discussions, Reddit insights).[^3]
- **Prompt Clarity and Structure:** Clear role definition and output expectations ensure ChatGPT focuses on Python debugging assistance with a user-friendly response style (Medium, BetterProgramming).[^4][^5]
- **Adaptability:** By avoiding direct solutions, this approach suits varying skill levels—beginners receive simple hints, while advanced users get deeper questions to ponder (DeepLearning.AI course).[^6]
- **Encouraging Reflection:** Incorporating guiding questions promotes active learning and debugging skills, as recommended by multiple prompt engineering resources (Huggingface prompt guide, PromptingGuide.ai).[^7][^8]
